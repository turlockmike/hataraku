hataraku -i "create a new project structure"
```

## Different Models/Providers

```bash
# Use different models
hataraku --model anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet "explain this codebase"
hataraku --model deepseek/deepseek-chat "optimize this function"

# Use different providers
hataraku --provider anthropic "write unit tests"
hataraku --provider openai "debug this code"
```

## Special Features

```bash
# Disable streaming for precise output
hataraku --no-stream "generate a JSON configuration"

# Disable sound for quiet operation
hataraku --no-sound "run silent task"

# Enable verbose mode for detailed output
hataraku --verbose "debug this complex issue"

# Web Interface
hataraku serve --port 3000
```

## Complex Tasks

```bash
# Multi-step operations
hataraku "create a full Express.js API endpoint with route, controller, and tests"

# Code generation with specific requirements
hataraku "create a TypeScript class that implements the Repository pattern"

# Project analysis
hataraku "analyze this project's structure and suggest improvements"
```

## Tool-Specific Tasks

```bash
# Image operations
hataraku "show me a diagram of the current project structure"

# Audio feedback
hataraku "play a sound when the task completes"

# Network operations
hataraku "fetch the latest version of Node.js and tell me what's new"

## Setup Requirements

Before running these commands, ensure you have:

1. Set up your API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
2. Are in the project directory
3. Have necessary permissions for file operations

Note: Some commands may require additional setup or dependencies depending on your system configuration.

## Available Tools

The CLI has access to the following tool categories:

- **File System Tools**: read_file, write_file, list_files, search_files, search_and_replace, insert_content, apply_diff
- **Network Tools**: fetch
- **System Tools**: execute_command
- **Code Analysis Tools**: list_code_definitions
- **Media Tools**: play_audio, show_image, text-to-speech (Kokoro TTS)

Each command above demonstrates the use of one or more of these tools to accomplish various tasks.
