When asked to come up with an implementation plan. It should have the following components.

1. A list of small tasks to do to complete the plan
2. For each task, some psuedocode of what will change with a brief explanation
3. Some design questions. Don't assume the user knows everything, scrutinize the ticket and focus on producing best outcomes based on what the user actually needs.
