When asked to come up with an implementation plan. It should have the following components.

1. A list of small tasks to do to complete the plan
2. For each task, some psuedocode of what will change with a brief explanation
3. Some design questions. Don't assume the user knows everything, scrutinize the ticket and focus on producing best outcomes based on what the user actually needs. 
4. Store Plans in the .agent folder
